# Decisions

Decision records preserve lasting product, architecture, data ownership,
security, compatibility, and validation choices that future work must inherit.

Use `docs/templates/decision.md`. Task-local implementation choices remain in
the active execution plan and do not require a separate decision.

The Git-native document and this index are authoritative for the default
workflow. The optional compatibility control plane may also carry a decision
row when an external orchestrator explicitly requires it.

## Reusable Decision Index

These decisions are part of the installed Harness contract. Source-only
maintenance decisions may remain in this repository without entering the
consumer payload.

Add a decision when:

- A locked technical choice changes.
- Product behavior changes meaningfully and alternatives have different
  consequences.
- Data ownership, authorization, privacy, security, or public compatibility is
  decided.
- A validation requirement is added, removed, or weakened.
- The source-of-truth hierarchy or default workflow changes.

Do not add a decision merely because a task mentions a sensitive domain or uses
a durable execution plan.
